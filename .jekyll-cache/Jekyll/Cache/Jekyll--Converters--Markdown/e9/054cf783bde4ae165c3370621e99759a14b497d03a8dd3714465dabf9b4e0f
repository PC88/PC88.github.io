<h2 id="introduction-post-0">Introduction: Post 0</h2>

<p>This post will detail an initial foray in to the world of Data Science and machine learning,
this will be done through analysis through the topic of AMGs(Auxiliary Metabolic Genes and the data surrounding them)</p>

<p>This project is a collaborative project done with my friend and fellow undergraduate student Daniel Macfarlane: who 
will be handling the marine science aspects of the project. This will entail an initial review of the relevant
literature in the form of the papers shown further on in this post. From this we hope to extract areas in which the 
research is lacking or needs further exploration and subsequently look for patterns or trends which can explored via
machine learning or other forms of data science,this will be my end of project. We hope this will reveal â€“ with any
luck â€“ some form of salient information on the topic.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this topic is being done first and foremost as a critical exercise to simply better each
of our selfâ€™s in our respective disciplines. We hope to deepen our understanding of the chosen topics and improve our
skills for future projects and various endeavours.</p>

<p>All details of this project from my end will be kept up-to-date on this blog category under this heading. The following
posts will be numbered to denote the order and are dated by default. For now,here is the starting point and some of my
motivations.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>

<p>Being a student of CGT (Computer Game Technology) a specific, and yet still broad discipline it may be hard to initially 
discern why I would foray in to the topic of data science, another broad topic. This motivation for me comes from a desire
to learn machine learning, a topic becoming increasingly prevalent in technical art in game development, as well as python 
in general. This project allows me to begin this pursuit in a uniquely productive way in which I get experience working in 
partnership with a student from a totally different discipline. Which I feel is a very excellent exercise as data science 
is a broad and far reaching domain touching from technical art and AI, to bio-informatics and psychological research which 
allows me to see how the application of data science is useful in the domain of marine science - AMGs in this case - and
then reflect that information back on to my own alternative goals and future projects, such as the aforementioned technical art.</p>

<p>I will also be seeking to accredit this project under the grounds of UWS (University of the West of Scotland`s)
collaboration award so it does have the opportunity to reflect on my academic record.</p>

<h2 id="a-starting-point">A starting Point</h2>

<p>This project will be on going for potentially a time period of up to a year form the authoring of this post, and there is a lot to
learn from my perspective. I will begin with a review of some of the papers that my colleague will also be reviewing, to garner some
initial insight in to this currently foreign domain simply to perhaps shed some clarity on what I will be looking for in the analytics
of this data. I will begin this aspect with an analysis of the paper:</p>

<p>Nissimov, J., Pagarete, A., Ma, F., Cody, S., Dunigan, D., Kimmance, S. and Allen, M. (2017).
Coccolithoviruses: A Review of Cross-Kingdom Genomic Thievery and Metabolic Thuggery. <em>Viruses</em>, 9(3), p.52.</p>

<p>The reason being that Nissimov, J. Will aid us in the research we aim to put forward as he is guiding Daniel with the marine science end
of the research and seeing as he co-authored the paper its as suitable a starting point as any. Moving from this the other papers which 
will form a basis are listed below, this list was compiled by Daniel Macfarlane:</p>

<p>I will then move to for effective ways to analyse this data with feed back from my colleague, utilising the python language and its analytical
libraries where necessary, with a notion of bending neural networks and machine learning towards this end. As I delve further 
in to this end I will create subsequent posts.</p>
