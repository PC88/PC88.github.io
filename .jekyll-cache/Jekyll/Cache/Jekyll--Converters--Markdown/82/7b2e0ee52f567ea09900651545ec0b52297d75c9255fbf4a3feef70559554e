<h2 id="introduction-post-0">Introduction: Post 0</h2>

<p>This post will detail an initial foray in to the world of Data Science and machine learning, this will be done through analysis 
through the topic of AMGs (Auxiliary Metabolic Genes and the data surrounding them)</p>

<p>This project is a collaborative project done with my friend and fellow undergraduate student Daniel Macfarlane: who will be handling the marine science aspects of the project. 
This will entail an initial review of the relevant literature in the form of the papers shown at the end of this post. From this we hope to extract areas in which the 
research is lacking or needs further exploration and subsequently look for patterns or trends which can explored via machine learning or other forms of data science,
this will be my end of project. We hope this will reveal â€“ with any luck â€“ some form of salient information on the topic. subsequent post</p>

<p>It is important to note that this topic is being done first and foremost as a critical exercise to simply better each of our selfâ€™s in our respective disciplines. 
We hope to deepen our understanding of the chosen topics and improve our skills for future projects and various endeavours.</p>

<p>All details of this project from my end will be kept up-to-date on this blog category under this heading. The following posts will be numbered to denote the order and are dated by default. For now
here is the starting point and some of my motivations.</p>
