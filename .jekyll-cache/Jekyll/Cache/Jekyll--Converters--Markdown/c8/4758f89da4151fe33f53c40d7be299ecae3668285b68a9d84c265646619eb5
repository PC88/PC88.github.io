<h2 id="introduction-post-0">Introduction: Post 0</h2>

<p>This post will detail an initial foray in to the world of Data Science and machine learning,
this will be done through analysis through the topic of AMGs(Auxiliary Metabolic Genes and the data surrounding them)</p>

<p>This project is a collaborative project done with my friend and fellow undergraduate student Daniel Macfarlane: who 
will be handling the marine science aspects of the project. This will entail an initial review of the relevant
literature in the form of the papers shown further on in this post. From this we hope to extract areas in which the 
research is lacking or needs further exploration and subsequently look for patterns or trends which can explored via
machine learning or other forms of data science,this will be my end of project. We hope this will reveal â€“ with any
luck â€“ some form of salient information on the topic.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this topic is being done first and foremost as a critical exercise to simply better each
of our selfâ€™s in our respective disciplines. We hope to deepen our understanding of the chosen topics and improve our
skills for future projects and various endeavours.</p>

<p>All details of this project from my end will be kept up-to-date on this blog category under this heading. The following
posts will be numbered to denote the order and are dated by default. For now,here is the starting point and some of my
motivations.</p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>

<p>Being a student of CGT (Computer Game Technology) a specific, and yet still broad discipline it may be hard to initially 
discern why I would foray in to the topic of data science, another broad topic. This motivation for me comes from a desire
to learn machine learning, a topic becoming increasingly prevalent in technical art in game development, as well as python 
in general. This project allows me to begin this pursuit in a uniquely productive way in which I get experience working in 
partnership with a student from a totally different discipline. Which I feel is a very excellent exercise as data science 
is a broad and far reaching domain touching from technical art and AI, to bio-informatics and psychological research which 
allows me to see how the application of data science is useful in the domain of marine science â€“ AMGs in this case â€“ and
then reflect that information back on to my own alternative goals and future projects, such as the aforementioned technical art.</p>

<p>I will also be seeking to accredit this project under the grounds of UWS (University of the West of Scotland`s)
 collaboration award so it does have the opportunity to reflect on my academic record.</p>
