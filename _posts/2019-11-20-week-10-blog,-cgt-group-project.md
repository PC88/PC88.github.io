## Week 10 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2

This week had a real focus for myself in getting all the remaining project documentation finished. I have this week completed the TDD, with a minor clean up such as citing some of the references remaining. This brings the TDD up to a final work count of around 5500 words and should pose a fairly comprehensive answer to many of the questions posed by the brief. After completed the TDD I moved to finishing there GDD. Axel Simon and I had some miscommunication over the GDD which they were working on over the last week or so, some of the sections I felt were a little under cooked and needed more fleshing out, this was discussed and they unanimously agreed that this was the case, they had just been struggling to flesh out sections that needed to be more verbose. Given that English is neither's first language this seems more than reasonable. They had done some very good work on the level design sections of the document however.

Picking up from where they left off the GDD comes in at around 5500 words also and around twenty-four pages. This also does need some minor changes to be added -- again some citing and bibliography. I am however very happy with it in conclusion and do expect it to get marked quite well.

Next week I should be looking to add the model loading classes, and port over the FBO for the stylised aesthetic of the game, as well as upload the respective documentation to the Wiki as per Pauls request.
