## Week 7 Blog:

It saddens me to say that this week I had a personal tragedy happen with a good friend of mine being the victim of an attempted murder, which lead to a very stress filled week with several days in and out of hospitals. With this happening my mind has been else where and little progress on the project has been made from my end. I was barely able to submit advanced graphics programming's assessment and simply could not keep up with the workload. This is simply unfortunate and could not have been foreseen. I will aim to catch up on this lost time in the coming two weeks as I made clear at this weeks bi-weekly meeting to the respective lectures. It is also gravely unfortunate that I will also be out of the country immediately following this meeting for four days for a trip which has been years in planning. I will not however allow this to tarnish the project in any largely meaningful capacity.

In an effort to avoid this I have said that upon my return on the 30^th^ of October I will be making a revised project plan to deal with the time loses and push to meet the losses of the time that has been lost. I believe committing to some form of model loading by week ten, as well as a more fleshed out version of the GDD is a reasonable commitment to make, as well as a more ridged project structure to ensure we have a firm grip of the time available to us.

As a group this week we also discussed a task Axel has been pursuing at length that of integrating various types of model creating applications and their impacts on the models once they are imported in to the game its self. Axel was working with blender to create some of the 3D models to make up the world in addition to many sourced assets, one of the issues that could be encountered by this is that of differing co-ordinates systems used in the packages. This is an issue that traditional game engines solve by converting models to their own in-house format, a luxury we will not be able to afford. We have agreed that in order to keep issues such as the differing orientations of the 3D-Models and other potential issues such as inverted normals to a minimum by keeping the package the same: that being blender and keeping textures for a minimum at least to start off with, a simple Bmp file will suffice to start off with
