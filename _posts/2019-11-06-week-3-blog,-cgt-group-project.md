## Week 3 Blog: 

This week I started the group repository up and added some initial code to it as a starting point. We discussed initial tools for what we will use for physics rendering and collision detection and agreed on several libraries after some debate. The libraries in question being Bullet3, glm, spd log, assimp, imgui, GLEW, GLFW. These dependencies were added and set up for debug x86 as in initial starting point by me.

This leads me to the power point which had to list some of the criteria discussed above, however I also did, make a blunder this week where I left the writing of the upcoming PowerPoint presentation quite late as it had slipped my mind, fortunately for me Axel reminded me a couple days in advance, and I wrote it up and discussed it with Axel and Simon. It did preoccupy me at the time that it stated that we should all speak and the intervals where Axel and Simon should comment are not obvious to me as asking them to comment on physics or animation at this stage doesn't seem fair nor reasonable.

We then delivered the power point and all-in-all I think it went well, although the criticism which was delivered from Paul and Moe was that the concept of the game, rather than the technology choices around it is not as clear as it could be by any means, a criticism which is fair and I take responsibility for as I could have made that more clear in the slides. We were also picked up on the fact that it was just a monologue from me, which I as stated earlier I did not see a wat around -- but this was in my honest opinion very forthrightly addressed. I simply stated that I cannot see how I can expect Axel and Simon to comment thoroughly on things they have not yet had incorporated in to their course, and that I simply do not have an answer for a solution to that. This sentiment was very fairly received as that, is factually the case with the group that we have. I spoke with Axel and Simon as well and they, surprisingly to me, did echo the sentiment that they would not feel confident is making claims on technology or project elements they have had limited or no exposure to before. They also generously offered to make any more slides or presentation aspects as the slide show its self was lacking in the aspects that were mentioned earlier, an offer I will make good on should the avenue arise.

We also received advice to integrate CICD tools to the project which is something I will look to add quickly.

We will aim to take this critique on board and especially rectify the idea of what the game is -- particularly in the GDD.
