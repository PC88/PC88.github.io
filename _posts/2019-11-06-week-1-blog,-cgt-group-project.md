## Week 1 Blog: 

- The initial week of the project the group we have formed is composed of me, Axel and Simon. This group has I feel already started well with both Simon and Axel being French exchange students who both have experience in source control C++ to a reasonable degree. This has done some good to assuage my concerns over the scope of the project and the trials of it which have, and should be, a concern of anyone who has undertaken this course so far.

In preparation of this module between last semester and the current time I have put some considerable effort in to furthering my understanding of many of the concepts and practises which will be executed in this module. This week I will begin to write up a model of my largest concern and core element of the project: The Renderer.

It is still very early days yet but upon speaking with Simon and Axel: although they are more likely to be more familiar with the core tenants of course control and C++ than others in the course, they will lack some knowledge with regards to specifics of Game Engine design in contrast to others who have taken the specific modules in prior years: RTCD, Game Physics etc. I am by no means an expert either, but we had a productive discussion which I spoke with them simply making them aware of where we may have to do a lot of learning as a unit, and where I felt some of the challenges of the course could threaten the project. Having acknowledges this we can now make steps to ensure the project goes smoothly as can be for all of us. They only concern the directly expressed -- was the unfamiliarity with OpenGL and graphics API`s.

This is something that may pan out quite well as I have spent a good deal of time thinking about this issue as many of the class have struggled with this concept, and it did require a good deal of extracurricular learning from myself, but this should present an interesting avenue to put that work in to action.

Lastly our group is still quite small, so we decided to keep the roles vague for now, generalist programmers
