## Week 8 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2

This week was constrained for time as mentioned in the prior blog. What I was able to achieve in this week was additions to the GDD in the gameplay section of the GDD. This involved fleshing out the section with relation to the physics and the elements of it, those being intuitive motion, verticality and examples of such. The example I primarily used is the example of the magic lamp in the Witcher three, for reasons outlined in the document I feel this was a particularly salient example.

My major commitment this week was the fleshing out of the TDD, the TDD is up to around 1800 words and has much of the major sections touched, with however much work to come. We also resolved an issue with the repository which was causing Simon and Axel some trouble in building, this was due to a memory issue with memory not being passed down through the loggers #includes in the project. The diagrams for the TDD including an almost 1:1 model class diagram have been constructed and referenced in the document.

In addition to the above I also reconstructed the Gantt chart to suit what the remaining time in the trimester and correct for some of the unfortunate circumstances which occurred earlier in the development. This in combination with a serious restructure of the Git projects, should allow us to manage our time much more effectively in the weeks to come, and make back much of the lost time.
