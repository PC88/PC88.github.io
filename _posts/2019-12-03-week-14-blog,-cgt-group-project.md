**Week 14 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2**

Now we have arrived at the final week, I have successfully rounded out all the documentation to my knowledge having completed the GDD and TDD, with all respective diagrams, the TDD finishing up at close to 7000 words and 20 pages, and the GDD ending up around 5400 words and 21 pages. Both are completed in full and on the wiki, which takes care of the majority share of the marks for the hand in. with blogs, evaluation, proposed plan, and actual plan, taking up the remaining 35% and the remaining 15% being our presentation on Wednesday.

Only the critical evaluation remains to be written up on my part, and I aim to use the last the day to purely focus on making the code more presentable. It is most definitely lacking for what I would have wanted at this point, however with that said in the time between now and next trimester being available solely to catchup on purely the code base I remain optimistic about our chances of producing a high-grade hand-in overall. Especially with this trimester`s marking scheme being far more focused on documentation rather than code base I feel with more of a focus on the code next trimester much more will be achieved.

During this week's work however, I also set about finishing up some of last week's work with regards to uploading the images mentioned earlier, this did not go without issue. It turns out that the wiki page a has a very low storage capacity for images, and we either do have permissions, or interface to remove them, nor does it prompt the user when the space is full. This resulted in the modules Moodle page -- with our wiki -- going down for several hours and breaking the manual upload functionality. -- This was resolved by using imgur to simply host all of the images via URL but did take an annoying amount of time to convert all some 40 images to jpeg from png and upload and change the format to URL instead of manual upload.

I feel in summary given some of the circumstances this year could have been better but was not too bad the documentation should carry the grade and any lacking in the code base will be made up for. We will most definitely have to improve time management for the next trimester being the main take away.
