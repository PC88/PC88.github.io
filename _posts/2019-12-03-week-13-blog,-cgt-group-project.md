**Week 13 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2**

This week the final hand in for AGP was due and took, sadly more time than it should have to complete with some disappointing results. In the remainder of the time of the week I have been going over marking scheme making sure we cover all the bases. Our code base will most definitely be behind where I would like it to be, due to some of the unfortunate set backs in week 8 and 9 having a domino effect on some of the latter work, despite my attempts to make time back up with a more ridged Git Project structure -- which I believe helped, but not entirely mitigate. This also did involve me not making the meeting that week having been up to 6am the previous day trying to meet prior commitments.

With regards to the actual work completed this week: when the GDD and TDD were posted to the wiki some weeks ago all of the diagrams, illustrations anything with an image format was removed by the wikis formatting. I spent several hours uploading the various diagrams and will finish this off next week. I also fixed and error in the class diagram in which I had omitted the entire shader class and its composite structures. Simon and Axel are still embroiled in their AGP hand in, and the next week now all tasks are cleared but the technology project will have to be productive to make up for much of the time we have lost so far. I intend to finish off all the remaining documentation and have at least some time to add more to the code base and make the demo more presentable for Wednesday. It however does not help that a scholarship I have been applying for in recent weeks has its submission on the day after, but this should not be too much of a time constraint.
