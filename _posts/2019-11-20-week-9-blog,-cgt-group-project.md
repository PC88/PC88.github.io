## Week 9 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2

This week much of my efforts went in to completing the TDD, the document is now up to 3000 words and has a good number of major sections completed. I, as mentioned in last weeks blog, went about restructuring the Git project, creating tasks from each of the criteria for the game, turning them into issued which can be visualised and tied to code commits. This also has tied us to the MoSCoW analysis which was given earlier in the year allowing us to to label issues with apriority in which to be added to the project. With this addition it will enable us to more effectively manage the multitude of tasks that still escape us in the time remaining.

To make rapid progress towards the deadlines set by the module I have also proposed another way to start implementing the code required. This is to make each demo a test sequence, we add a demo class test iterate and them merge it into the overarching system on a granular basis over the coming weeks. This allows us to rapidly prototype and diagnose and resulting issues with tasks. I should hopefully start integrating code in the coming week, it is frustrating that I was not able to get a form of model loading in by this week, but the documentation of the project is amore a current priority taking up around 50% of the mark for this submission, nonetheless time is most definitely pressing at this point.

Simon and Axel have also started working this week, meaning I had to present solo at this week's meeting, however not an issue in an of its self it adds more time constraints that will surely be felt by the project.
