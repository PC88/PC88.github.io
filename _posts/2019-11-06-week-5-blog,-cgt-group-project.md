## Week 5 Blog: 

This week I added base code from several other project I have worked on to add an initial demo system to the project so as Axel and Simon can make quick projects to initially integrate physics, Animation, and for my self to integrate Graphics via a renderer. I initially started this by creating a demo which will use some essential graphics elements such as Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and rendering an indexed cube from some in code values, not model loaded yet. I will aim to add this for the next bi-weekly meeting.

This I was able to show at this week's meeting to show a decent amount of initial progress and talk to some length about where I want to go from here. I also put this section in to a UML class diagram, however there is a huge amount for improvement as is to be expected at this stage. Moe in this weeks meeting did state he would be willing to look over the UML and some of its design which should lead to some very productive feed back for us as a unit.

Axel and Simon continued to make changes to the GDD, adding some thoughts to the top of the document and Axel specifically was toying with a few ideas about restructuring the document in some ways.

I also gave some forewarning this week although I feel I made good progress this week I have several hand ins coming up for other modules and this will constrain my time with regards to the technology group project its self.
