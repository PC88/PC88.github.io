**Week 12 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2**

As we approach the end of the year naturally the work load is steadily piling on, and time is most definitely hard to keep track of. I spent much of this week studying for the class test of Algorithms and collections which took up at least a day or so of my time, this combined with the AGP hand in looming also constrained my efforts. What I did this week was revise the Gantt chart accurately reflect what had happened this year, as per the spec, as well as mirror a viable software development methodology for the next trimester. I landed on RAD rapid application development, as the cycle suits our agile approach and sprint integration with the demo system.

With Axel and Simon now working, and the unfortunate news of Simon's computer breaking down the last few weeks will no doubt turn into a rather stressful scramble to assemble a demo which looks presentable, as well as a comprehensive set of documentation.

On the topic of documentation, I added some citations to the TDD and added some more detail on each of the sub systems brining it up to around 6000 words at this point. I will go over these at least once more in the following weeks before hand-ins to keep the standard up, as well as keep the wiki up-to-date with entries made to the documents.
