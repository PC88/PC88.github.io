## Week 6 Blog:

This week I looked at integrating Slack in to our project, as of now we are simply using discord which in all fairness does meet the groups needs quite comprehensively having screen share, text channels, and voice channels, as well as uploads of a limited size. The reasons for integrating Slack is simply to have our CI-CD tools operate off of a bot which will auto post updates and commits to the repository once they have been made. That, as well as Slack being a industry version of discord, it is very similar to discord in its resemblance, whether we use the rest of the functionality which overlaps with discord is a different question but I feel we should definitely implement at least its capabilities for this bot which we now have set up. -- This does still bring back the MS Build tools error, which is still yet to be resolved. 

This week was the submission for the module of Creative technologies and professionalism which did take up a good deal of my time this week. It is also worth mentioning that the submission for Advance Graphic Programming is also in the next week and is quite intensive. In an effort to be efficient I have made efforts to integrate code between the two modules as this not only tests that code for its orthogonality but allows for any graphics elements developed to be integrated in AGP and moved over to the main project should that be useful.

This week I also finished off a first draft of the GDD section on Look and Feel. I added more detail on visual style appearance and sound, such as a list of epithets I feel should be evoked from the games visuals and general aesthetic.
