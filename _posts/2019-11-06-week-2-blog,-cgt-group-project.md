## Week 2 Blog: 

This week was very productive for our group. We created a discord server and talked, online and in person this week about what the planned game should be. We arrived at the idea of a first-person puzzle game this idea as soon as it was announced immediately gained traction. With me and Axel talking at good length about some of the successive games in this genre which could serve as - practical -- and none the less inspiring examples. These being games such as Anti-Chamber, The Witness, and others. I stated that this example also allows us to be as simplistic as possible with great room for extension which we all agreed is a large benefit to the project. Simon suggested that as a core premise we take the initial idea that the game be an escape room game which both me and Axel thought would be a solid initial premise.

We also determined as per lecturers request a more specific outline of roles, so I put forward the idea that I should be the lead in terms of project direction and documentation. The reasons I put my self forward for this is I consider myself quite a decisive person, I like to be clear in terms of what it is that needs to be done and quickly set about doing it. I also have had several other group projects before in which I have had to create a game: In college specifically. In these projects I have been bitten before by lack of incisiveness from prior groups so this is a lesson I should carry forward. With that said it obviously has its downsides -- coming off as overbearing, dictatorial or any other negative epithet you wat to attribute which what can come of being decisive. So at every interval I will, and have made clear that is Axel of Simon wish to take anything explicitly over or have any input simply offering it and we will incorporate it if we all agree, and like wise with anything I think up I focus os suitably justifying, and making sure we are on the same page. The other conclusions we drew from this is that I should be delegated the graphics aspects of the project to a degree, physics with Simon, and Animation with Axel, the rest of the responsibilities, as well as those to some degree, being shared amongst us all.

Following this I wrote up a MoSCoW analysis of the project, based on the premise and wrote a class diagram for the initial ideas of going about the Rendering architecture. I will aim to start writing the starter dependencies and repository up next week
