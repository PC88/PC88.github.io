**Week 23 Blog Technology group project, Peter Cannon, CGT Group 2**

The week starting the 5^th^ sprint

This week has been unfortunately quite sparse for workload as there have been multiple hand-ins and tests for other modules during the course of this week, as the year in becoming quite stressful, as per usual, as it comes to a close. This was the test for Computer Game AI as well as that modules second submission, which I submitted this week early to manage time for the project in the coming weeks.

I feel it is also important to note that this week I pointed out that I wish to limit my attendance as much as possible to the University as the Coronavirus pandemic is becoming quite rooted in the UK. This I hope will actually make me more productive in the coming weeks, and hopefully will not negatively affect myself or any member of the team.  

What I did do this week with regards to the project is start on some of the entity refactoring and adding some of the layers of abstraction discussed in previous blogs. This involved accommodating the transform changes by using a simple float array, which does need more work in the following weeks, as well as building in the changes incrementally to the demo as we progress to ensure the project still functions at each interval.
